Track Your Score: Keep an eye on your score and high score to see how well you're doing.
Intuitive Controls: Use the arrow keys to control your car's movement (up, down, left, right).

## Under the Hood (Technologies Used):

HTML: Provides the foundation for the game's structure, defining elements like the score display, high score, start screen, and game area.
CSS: Injects style and visual elements, creating the background road, opponent cars, your car, and other visual components.
JavaScript: Makes the game interactive! It handles car movement based on your key presses, opponent car generation and movement, collision detection, scorekeeping, and overall game logic.
